          # Uses default "ci" mode for context-aware scanning:
          # - Differential scans for pull requests (including forks)
          # - Full scans for main branch pushes
          # - pull_request_target allows PR comments from forks
          # - Can override with scan-mode: "scan" for explicit full scans
