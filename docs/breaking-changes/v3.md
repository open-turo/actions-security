# Breaking Changes for v3

## Introduction

The v3 version of the open-turo/actions-security repository introduces a significant refactoring of the Semgrep configuration path. These changes are designed to enhance maintainability and consistency across consuming repositories. However, this update may require action from repositories using older configurations to prevent workflow disruptions.

However, this update requires **manual changes** to the workflow files to prevent any inconsistencies and failures.

## Breaking Change Details

### 1. Refactored Path for security-scan.yaml

- _What Changed_:

  - The action.yaml file for Semgrep has been moved from:

    ```
    open-turo/actions-security/static-analysis/semgrep@v1
    ```

    _to:_

    ```
    open-turo/actions-security/static-analysis@v3
    ```

- _Impact_:
  - Any workflow file referencing the old path (static-analysis/semgrep@v1) will fail to locate the action and result in pipeline failures.

### 2. Standarized Job Name

- _What Changed_:

  -The Job name has been updated from `security-scan` to :

  ```
  code-scan
  ```

- _Impact_:

  -Workflow using the old job name (`security-scan`) will cause validation error or confusion with file name

### 3. Added Pull Request Condition

- _What Changed:_
  A condition has been added to ensure the Semgrep job runs _only on pull request events_:
  ```yaml
  if: github.event_name == 'pull_request'
  ```
- _Impact:_
  Without this condition, the Semgrep job may unnecessarily trigger on other events, leading to redundant scans.

## Migration Instructions

### Step 1: Update Workflow Files

1. Locate all GitHub Actions workflow files in your repository referencing static-analysis/semgrep.
2. Make the following changes:

   - **Update the Semgrep action path**:

     ```yaml
     uses: open-turo/actions-security/static-analysis@v3
     ```

   - **Rename the job name**:

     ```yaml
     jobs:
       code-scan:
         name: Code scan
     ```

   - **Add the pull request condition**:
     ```yaml
     if: github.event_name == 'pull_request'
     ```

### Step 2: Validate Workflow

1. After updating the workflow file, trigger the GitHub Actions pipeline by raising a pull request.
2. Verify the following:
   - The pipeline runs successfully.
   - The updated job name code-scan appears in the workflow logs.
   - Semgrep runs only on pull request events.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Errors

- _Error_: Failed to locate action: open-turo/actions-security/static-analysis/semgrep@v1

  - _Solution_: Update the uses field to open-turo/actions-security/static-analysis@v3.

- _Error_: Workflow file is invalid: Unexpected value 'semgrep-app-token'
  - _Solution_: Ensure the required secrets are configured correctly in your repository:
    - Add SEMGREP*APP_TOKEN under \_Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions*.

---

### Debugging Tips

- Verify the following in your updated security-scan.yaml file:

  - _Action Path:_ open-turo/actions-security/static-analysis@v3
  - _Job Name:_ code-scan
  - _Condition:_ if: github.event_name == 'pull_request'

- Use the GitHub Actions logs to identify and troubleshoot specific errors.

## Example Updated Workflow File

Below is an example of an updated GitHub Action workflow file using v3:

```yaml
name: Security scan
on:
  pull_request: {}
  workflow_dispatch: {}
  push:
    branches: [main]
jobs:
  code-scan: # Updated Job Name
    name: Code scan # Updated Display Name
    runs-on: [self-hosted, general-ubuntu]
    if: github.event_name == 'pull_request' # Added Condition
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: open-turo/actions-security/static-analysis@v3 #Updated Path
        with:
          semgrep-app-token: ${{ secrets.SEMGREP_APP_TOKEN }}
```
